Discover the NYC Taxi Tip Prediction project, a comprehensive endeavor focusing on data analysis and predictive modeling using R programming. Within this repository, find meticulously documented R scripts and associated datasets used for in-depth analysis of NYC taxi trip data. Leveraging libraries such as ggplot2, caret, and mgcv, the project scrutinizes intricate relationships between variables, executes data partitioning techniques, and applies diverse predictive modeling approaches. From linear regression models to logistic regression models, each analysis is methodically presented, accompanied by detailed evaluations, including Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) calculations for regression models and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for logistic regression, to assess predictive performance on test datasets. This repository serves as a valuable resource for enthusiasts seeking insights into statistical analysis, data visualization, and predictive modeling in the transportation domain.
